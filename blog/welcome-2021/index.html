  Welcome to 2021 ... my third first post
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>January 29, 2021</strong></p>
<p>This is the third restart of this website. I'm hoping that third time is the charm. It's 2021 and I think that we are all hoping that 2021 is better than 2020. I have to say that 2020 was pretty good to me. I recently moved from NYC in January 2020 to join my better half in Montreal. I avoided the pandemic in NYC (although I did feel some guilt regarding my friends and colleagues at Columbia University Medical Center ... I think that they did a great job ... along with all the other front line healthcare workers who were challenged by COVID19). I changed jobs and have found a wonderful group of pediatricians with whom to work. While we were quite hit by the pandemic here in Montreal, it was definitely not as bad as in the NYC area. My parents were much relieved. I've been able to contribute as a consultant to a US healthcare company as a healthcare data scientist/engineer. Jess and I bought a house (actually that started in 2020 but it will finish shortly). So it's been a crazy 2020.</p>
