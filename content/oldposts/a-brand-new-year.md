Welcome to 2019!

I've changed my layout to academic and my setup to use github pages and hugo with continous integration with travis.

I've also published a few posts that I have been in the works. They are incomplete but I wanted to get them on so that I have an incentive to complete them.

I'm looking forward to the changes that 2019 will bring.

More to come ...
