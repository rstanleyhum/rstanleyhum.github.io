So after much research I have decided to use the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). One of the reasons is that it is written in golang so that the code compiles to a single executable in either windows, linux and/or macOS which makes installation and usage really easy. No dependencies. No other programming languages.

The biggest decision that I had to make was which of the many [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/), I was going to use. Originally, I really liked the [Ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme and even cropped one of my photos of Ottawa for the home page.

But I found that I couldn't format the code blocks appropriately. With some experimentation, I found that it had to do, I think, with the [Tachyon](http://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/) library.

So I ultimately gave up and I thought I might use the Academic theme but I felt that I wanted this website to look less about my professional life and I wanted it to have a more relaxed feel.

I ultimately picked the [Minimal](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/) theme. We will see how things go.
