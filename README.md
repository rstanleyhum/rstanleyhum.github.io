Thoughts on Medicine and Technology
===================================

This repository holds the contents of my personal website.

I use the awesome Hugo (https://gohugo.io) as my static website generator.

I use the Hugo theme of Minimal (https://themes.gohugo/io/minimal)

I use Firebase (https://firebase.google.com) as my hosting service.

I use Pipelines and a Docker image with Hugo and firebase-cli (npm based) to upload the site automatically upon commit to master.
