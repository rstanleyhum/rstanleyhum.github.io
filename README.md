Stanley Hum's website
===================================

This repository holds the contents of my website.

Initially, I used the awesome Hugo (https://gohugo.io) as my static website generator.

I also used the Hugo theme of Minimal (https://themes.gohugo/io/minimal)

I used to use Firebase (https://firebase.google.com) as my hosting service with Pipelines and a Docker image with Hugo and firebase-cli (npm based) to upload the site automatically upon commit to master.

But I converted over to Github, Travis CI with Hugo and deploying to Github Pages.

Now I have moved the Zola static website generator and Github Actions
