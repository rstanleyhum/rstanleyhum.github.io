  Starting Out With Hugo
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>August 18, 2017</strong></p>
<p>So after much research I have decided to use the static site generator <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. One of the reasons is that it is written in golang so that the code compiles to a single executable in either windows, linux and/or macOS which makes installation and usage really easy. No dependencies. No other programming languages.</p>
<p>The biggest decision that I had to make was which of the many <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a>, I was going to use. Originally, I really liked the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/">Ananke</a> theme and even cropped one of my photos of Ottawa for the home page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.stanleyhum.com/archive/starting-out-with-hugo/ottawa.jpg" alt="By the canal in Ottawa in the summer." /></p>
<p>But I found that I couldn't format the code blocks appropriately. With some experimentation, I found that it had to do, I think, with the <a href="http://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/">Tachyon</a> library.</p>
<p>So I ultimately gave up and I thought I might use the Academic theme but I felt that I wanted this website to look less about my professional life and I wanted it to have a more relaxed feel.</p>
<p>I ultimately picked the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/">Minimal</a> theme. We will see how things go.</p>
